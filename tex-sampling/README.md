#tex-sampling
This repository provides basic functions to implement the Random-Walk Molecular Dynamics (RWMD) methodology.
Briefly, RWMD is a random-walk through temperature space, similar to parallel tempering techniques.
After an interval number of steps, a Monte Carlo step is attempted to change the simulation temperature to an adjacent temperature window. If the proposed temperature has been visited less frequently, it is accepted. If not, a random number [0, 1) is computed and compared to `exp(frequencies[current_T] - frequencies[attempt_T])`. If the random number is less than this quantity, accept the move. If not, keep the current temperature for the next interval.

## How to use
This code provides the bare-bone algorithm for choosing temperatures and storing them into a dictionary of temperatures and frequencies (`pyrex.py`). Incorporate this package into your own workflows and simulation engines as necessary.
